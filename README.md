# Web Infrastructure Design

## Learning Objectives:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

    You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
    You must be able to explain what each component is doing
    You must be able to explain system redundancy
    Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

### General
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* This project will be manually reviewed:
*As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
* For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
* After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
* You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
* Focus on what you are being asked:
* Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
* Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
* Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
* In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked.
